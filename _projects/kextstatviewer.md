[KextStatViewer](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/KextStatViewer) is a small utility application for macOS to visualise the output of `kextstat` command which displays the present state of the XNU kernel extensions (kexts). It also provides a few useful features such as dynamic updates, searching/filtering and display details about a kext.
