[SetEdit](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/SetEdit) stands for **Set**tings Database **Edit**or which allows an Android user to browse and modify setting items that aren't accessible from the Android Settings application. It is inspired by [an application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=by4a.setedit22) by the same name which was abandoned for some time. It offers a better user interface and features such as searching and exporting the items.
