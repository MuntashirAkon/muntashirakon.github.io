[Android Debloat List](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/android-debloat-list) is a recent project whose primary goal is to catalogue preinstalled applications that aren't vital to the core operations of the operating system yet cannot be deleted from the system (also known as 'bloatware') due to restrictions put by OEM. This is one of the first independent projects to systematically list bloatware as well as suggest alternatives to the applications. At the same time, we're also cataloguing system applications with known vulnerabilities such as RCE or privilege escalation vulnerabilities. This is still a work in progress (listed over 2,400 system applications) and no stable version has been released yet. My other project, <a href="https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager">App Manager</a>, make use of the project to allow its users get rid of those bloatware (the process is known as 'debloating'). When a stable version will be released, third-party apps will also be able to use the catalogue in their apps. The list of bloatware can also be browsed online: <https://muntashirakon.github.io/android-debloat-list/>
