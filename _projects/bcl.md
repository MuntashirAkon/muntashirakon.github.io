[Battery Charge Limiter](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/BatteryChargeLimiter) is a utility software aims at improving battery lifespan of Android devices. This is done by maintaining two threshold points. When the upper threshold point has reached, the charging stops automatically, and when the lower threshold point has reached, the charging begins again. It requires root permission to work and is deprecated since Android 13 as most devices with Android 13 already offer similar functionalities.
