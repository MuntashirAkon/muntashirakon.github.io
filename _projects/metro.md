[Metro](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/Metro) is a fork of [Retro Music Player](https://github.com/RetroMusicPlayer/RetroMusicPlayer) that improves usability and removes privacy-evading features such as the usage of Google Play's billing library, fetching album and artist data from [last.fm](https://last.fm/) or audioscrobbling to it. The internet permission itself is removed from the application to avoid leaving any space for exploitation when opening untrusted music files and playlists.
